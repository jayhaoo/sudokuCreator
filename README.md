# sudokuCreator

I made this since I backtracking is interesting. This is a very basic sudoku game creator but my idea was to build this first in java then create this in javascript with visual effects so that people are able to see how backtrack works in real time. I'm learning javascript during my free time this semester but we'll see how much I get done since I have senior teams and taking 18 credits.
